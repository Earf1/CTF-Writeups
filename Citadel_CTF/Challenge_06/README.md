# Rotten Apple

## Description

Among the debris of this floor, you find a relic of sound: An album which turns out to be D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L by Panchiko, a long lost album. But the music is warped, as though it has undergone disc rot.

The path forward is hidden in the distortion. Similar to how the album was warped, the password to the next floor has been warped first by a factor of 47, then by a factor of 13. Untangle these changes to reveal the code and continue your ascent.

`4:R256=Y3oRRoP0#~%Ro?A`


## Solution

Fairly simple, i first did rot-47 to get `4:E256=L3bEEbC0#~%Eb?N`, then i did rot-13 to get the flag `citadel{b3tt3r_ROTt3n}`

## Flag
`citadel{b3tt3r_ROTt3n}`
