# track 8

## Description

Bypassing the second chamber leads to an empty floor except for a single artifact in the center: an old MP3 player, scratched and worn. On its surface, a cipher is etched, a message left behind for anyone who can decode it:

`twj eys zpr ukm 'viamnwqw' bx lzgo: esmqqui{yyr_oshwwcm_bwupa}`

When you power it on, the sound fills the chamber. The tracks play like whispers from a lost world, and you recognize it as a song from Panchiko’s latest studio album, particularly track no. 8. Its title feels familiar, hinting at a famous cipher. Decrypt it by using the album name as your key and continue your ascent.

## Solution

Panchiko's latest album was named ginkgo and track8 is named vinegar which is close to vignere

i used "ginkgo" as the key and got `now use the key 'panchiko' on flag: rigckmv{osd_ikumqog_tjkjm}`

using "pachinko" now i got the flag `citadel{add_vinegar_twice}`

## Flag
`citadel{add_vinegar_twice}
